With Remote Numpad, you can add the convenience of a numeric keypad to your laptop.

You can use this numpad in 3 different ways.

Using the Bluetooth HID profile (experimental), you can use Remote Numpad with any Bluetooth-enabled device (Android P or more required).

Using the classic Bluetooth or TCP (Wi-Fi) connections, a server application needs to be running on the device. The server can be downloaded from "https://github.com/theolizard/remote-numpad-server/releases" where you will also find more information.

IMPORTANT: The classic Bluetoooth and TCP (Wi-Fi) connections WILL NOT WORK if the server is not running on the other device.

A tutorial video can be found at "https://youtu.be/xTfQparcgg4".

The project is open source and all contributions are welcome over at "https://github.com/theolizard/remote-numpad".
