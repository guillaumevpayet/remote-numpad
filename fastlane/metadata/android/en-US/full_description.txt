With Remote Numpad, you can add the convenience of a numeric keypad to your laptop.

IMPORTANT: In order to use Remote Numpad with a laptop, you need to download the server application from "https://github.com/theolizard/remote-numpad-server/releases" and make sure it is running when attempting to connect. The server requires Java to operate. If you do not have it, you can download it from "java.com". A tutorial video can be found at "https://youtu.be/xTfQparcgg4".

The server application is available as a single file which will run on Windows, MacOS and Linux. All you have to do is double-click it and the server will appear in the system tray.

You can connect to the computer using either TCP (WiFi over local network) or Bluetooth (except on Linux).

The project is open source and all contributions are welcome over at "https://github.com/theolizard/remote-numpad".
